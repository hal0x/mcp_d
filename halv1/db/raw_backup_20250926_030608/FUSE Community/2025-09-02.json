{"id": 7, "text": "What is Fuse?\n\nFuse is a platform for minting stickers on-chain\n\nIts where your digital life becomes something you actually own.\n\nThink of it like this: instead of just liking, sharing, and scrolling past content that disappears, you can collect digital stickers that represent who you are and what you care about.\n\nEach sticker on Fuse is more than just a picture. It's a piece of culture you can keep forever. Whether it's from your favorite Web2 brand, a Web3 project you believe in, or a creator whose work speaks to you.\n\nWe're built on TON, which means everything you collect lives in your wallet, not on a platform that could change the rules tomorrow.  Your collection travels with you wherever you go.\n\nFuse isn't about chasing the next trend or filling up your feed with noise. \n\nWe curate collections that matter, from brands and creators who are building something lasting.\n\nYour digital choices should feel intentional, not accidental. That's what we're here for.\n\nFuse is officially live. \n\nExplore the Mini App on Telegram now, there might be a surprise waiting for you.\n\n[https://t.me/fuse](https://t.me/fuse)", "date": "2025-09-02T18:01:37+00:00", "chat": "FUSE Community"}
