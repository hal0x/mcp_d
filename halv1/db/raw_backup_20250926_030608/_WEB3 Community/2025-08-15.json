Every time a player loses, 🔥**3.3% of their WEB3 is burned forever**. No refunds. No recycling. Just fewer tokens in circulation and more scarcity driving value upward.\n\nAnd we’re just getting started. WEB3 is the core token of [**webdom**](https://webdom.market/analytics/stats)** — the first domain marketplace in TON built on Tolk, **the next-gen smart contract language. Soon, you’ll see WEB3 in even more games, features, and events where burning happens faster than ever.\n\nThe earlier you enter, the bigger your advantage when scarcity hits full swing.\n\n__The supply is going down. The ecosystem is going up. The best is yet to come.__\n\n#WEB3 #Crypto #web3lottery #webdom #DeflationaryToken #TON", "date": "2025-08-15T13:39:31+00:00", "chat": "$WEB3 Community"}
