{"id": 32, "text": "As of September 11th, TON Strategy Co. (Nasdaq: $TONX) disclosed:\n\n$TON tokens: 217,529,634\nFully diluted common shares outstanding: 62,486,673\nUnencumbered cash: $67 million\nTreasury Asset Value (TAV): $761,087,677\n\nTAV per share: $12.18\n\nWe've initiated our $250M buyback program, repurchasing >250K shares at an average price of $8.32 (~30% below TAV), and begun staking $TON for recurring on-chain revenues!\n\nThe buyback program, launched Sept 8 with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. as agent, allows flexible repurchases to enhance shareholder value. Buying below TAV underscores our commitment to our stockholders and our financial strength.\n\nThe initiation of staking marks a key evolution: By securing the TON network with our holdings, we earn additional $TON yields, creating sustainable income alongside treasury appreciation. This flywheel - accumulation, staking, and growing our $TON holdings - positions us to compound value per share over time.\n\nOur Executive Chairman @manuelstotz said it best: “These buybacks and staking milestones demonstrate our conviction in both the durability of the Company’s balance sheet and the long-term opportunity we see ahead...together with buybacks below TAV per share, these steps reinforce our strategy of steadily compounding value per share.”\n\nFull press release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250912905903/en/TON-Strategy-Company-Announces-Initial-Share-Repurchases-Under-%24250-Million-Program-Buying-Below-Treasury-Asset-Value-Per-Share-and-Start-of-Staking?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark", "date": "2025-09-12T12:37:06+00:00", "chat": "TON Strategy Co.
