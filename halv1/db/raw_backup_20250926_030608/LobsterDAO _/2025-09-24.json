{"id": 546100, "text": "The short explanation is that the valued accrued by the leveragors is computed using the ideal formula assuming leverage is maintain perfectly constant, i.e., the derivative of the payoff curve is constant. The liquidity to pay  these leveragors is taken from the LPers. This relation between leveragors and LPers is maintained while price creeps up until the ratio between the capital for leveragors and LPers is 1/(leverage-1). At this point the capital from LPers it no sufficient enough to sustain the convex gains and the leveragors positions gracefully degrades to a linear payoff curve akin to a margin trade.\n\nEffectively this design means LPers are also long but leverage <1 and as price rumps up, they sell the asset until we reach price upperbound where they are completely converted their holdings to USD (assuming a vault where USD is the reference asset). Similar to impermanent loss in Uniswap. \n\nSo the caveat to no volatility decay is that it is true till we reach the price upper-bound which depends on the amount of liquidity. If liquidity keeps coming online because leveragors keep piling in, this ceiling could raise up over time .", "date": "2025-09-24T19:54:39+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}
