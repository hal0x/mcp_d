{"id": 543893, "text": "Does anyone actually have a good reason why assets like wAVAX have such low LTV limits?\n\nIMO it seems to stem from a misunderstanding about how market microstructure works but perhaps I’m missing something.\n\nLTV limit of 70% assumes that a liquidation (or series of liquidations) in a single block might move the price by -30% hence the haircut. Or cause a critical “avalanche” effect by causing other liquidations >30% slippage that give momentum to a price collapse / flash crash. \n\nIt seems to me that people have mistakenly applied Value-at-Risk models when they should have applied slippage models AND/OR they are massively mis-modelling the cascade effect.", "date": "2025-09-03T00:36:49+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}
