{"id": 544611, "text": "Great question — I don’t think there’s a single “correct path,” but there are definitely paths that undermine the ethos of decentralization and others that only pretend to serve it.\n\nProjects face three funding phases (over simplifying here):\n\n— Early (pre-product) — high risk, lots of uncertainty. ICOs have purity but are dangerous for retail (diligence burden, scams, compliance). Best path here is angels/VCs who can underwrite real risk.\n\n— Mid-stage (post-MVP) — de-risked, tangible product. This is where raising from community makes the most sense, since people can actually evaluate the product. Unfortunately, most projects default to big VC rounds here — and this is when VC capital often turns predatory (short time to liquidity, misaligned incentives). Intuition is in this stage now, and we’re leaning community-first, which I think is the healthier path. \n\n— Growth (post-token) — ideally transparent, with funding tied to DAO governance and community decisions.", "date": "2025-09-10T15:18:53+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}
