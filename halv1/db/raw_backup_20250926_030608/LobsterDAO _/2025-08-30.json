It’s definitely easy to fork Uniswap and it might work perfectly fine but in case of lending protocols, there is set of business logic to understand and mechanics that without understanding properly, might create some substantial losses for their users. It can be as simple as applying wrong type of oracle configuration. If someone would really be interested to fork and provide the best value for their users and best resourcing to succeed, they would simply opt in with friendly fork frameworks.", "date": "2025-08-30T13:17:29+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}
