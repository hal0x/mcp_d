{"id": 545887, "text": "You are either good at storytelling AND have the right insider connections (very warm intros) which requires a ton of VC conversations these days searching for a lead - or your numbers are awesome. The latter I assume is not an option at the moment. It’s mostly always about the former anyway. The VCs who were active before, indeed, many of them have become dormant as venture is eating shit since 2022. It is what it is, you have to get kore calls done, go into tradfi VCs who fuck around with crypto (to get more $$), do trad angels, etc. It’s a more tedious process these days, for majority of cases. Crypto-native raises are rarer these days, and are more about big scammy L1s. Hello, the fat thesis, goodbye, any sensible risk-taking.\n\n“VCs are paid for branding” is a no, only some scammy syndicates give such offers, but nobody treats this as signaling and this service has been around for a long time. If you mean doing deals like VC + advisory - is an option, but you also need to have the “known” funds offer this, not random ones (polychain rumors are now known, there are some others). But that could help at least, however, you kinda need to get pretty close with them.", "date": "2025-09-22T07:56:07+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}
