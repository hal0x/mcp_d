Mitch had positions spread across many protocols and it was clear that once one was hit, it would trigger a massive cascade onto the others.

He managed to stave off the inevitable for some time in inventive ways, like incentivising liquidity on fraxlend to bring down utilisation as he was bleeding like crazy there. But he was increasingly hunted - when the market saw him collecting rewards from couch cushions, it was a signal he had no cash left to backstop the positions. afaik some marketmakers (wintermute?) handled the liquidation in a pretty orderly fashion.
