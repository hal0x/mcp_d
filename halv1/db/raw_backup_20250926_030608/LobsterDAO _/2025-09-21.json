Max liquidation sizes scale a bit with pool depth as you'd imagine...\n\nAs a rule of thumb it's pretty safe (99% certain) to assume single liquidations will be <$600k for pools <$1bn in size\n\nFor pools >$1bn, liqudations scale roughly as 6bps of the total depth", "date": "2025-09-21T19:58:20+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}
