It also has \"pessimistic proofs\" which basically makes sure no chain can withdraw from this unified bridge more than it put in, so less spillover risk if a chain gets rekt.\n\nI go through it a bit in this old talk: https://youtu.be/u7fJ0oECxQU?si=_LijWPQwY-S_cNP0", "date": "2025-08-27T06:47:14+00:00", "chat": "LobsterDAO 🦞"}

Also just to be clear - there's absolutely no re-hypothecation. \n\nStargate has an offchain planning module that dynamically updates prices. This only ever goes above \"market\" rate for one reason. A very very popular pathway that is draining a particular pool on a particular chain will drive up fees so as to protect the protocol from reducing it's liquidity on that chain too quickly. Bera->Ethereum has this happen sometimes because frankly it's quite popular. Simultaneously, the protocol will incentivise the reverse routes (Ethereum-> ** any other chain) so as to improve the liquidity. Sophisticated actors quite quickly spot these opportunities and take the arb.\n\nThis is described in our docs, and is well understood by all of our partners who we launch with. We're working on plenty of ways to make this more invisible to the users - so apologies that you had this happen, but it'll become less frequent.
