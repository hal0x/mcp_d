On the other side, crypto-native people who don’t buy into every vanity metric they see - and like to have a bit more proof than “trust me bro”.\n\nThe outcome is very obvious though: the big money corporates will just recreate the dashboards, metrics, and information - pushing out whatever we deemed to be essential before.
