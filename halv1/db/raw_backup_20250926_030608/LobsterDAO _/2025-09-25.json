Alternatively, there's a flip side where they stack teams with too many inexperienced people by picking them up like stray animals, where you won't get much of anything from it. \nBD has always been around, but they largely fell into the bucket of people lacking experience on doing business trying to deal with other people who are equally incapable of doing business because it's all very easy when times are good and crypto is pumping but these projects should have been run as businesses from day 1.
