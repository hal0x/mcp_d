{"id": 175, "text": "**Mainnet validators**\nScheduled voting on September 16\n\nWe are asking validators to schedule a time on Tuesday, ** September 16 **at **12:00 UTC** for network parameters voting.\n\nProposed voting is related to BTC Teleport operation and will allow to pass to [next stage](https://t.me/tonstatus/172) of Teleport rollout. Parameter `-90`, planned to be updated, won't directly affect network behavior and related to internal Teleport migration.\n\nUpd: we also added to the list of planned parameters to update config 29, in particular bumping `proto_version` from `4` to `5`. This will enable special overlays that will speed up synchronization of collator nodes.", "date": "2025-09-05T09:59:50+00:00", "chat": "TON Status"}
