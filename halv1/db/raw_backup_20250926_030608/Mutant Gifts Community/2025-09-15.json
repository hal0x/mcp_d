{"id": 52, "text": "😶‍🌫️ **Dear friends, we’d like to tell you about a rather challenging but very important update.**\n\nRight now, the giveaway system in the weekly and seasonal leaderboards works on the principle of “the earlier you start — the more chances you have.” As a result, only a small number of players end up at the top, competing exclusively with each other, while the rest find it difficult to keep up — since everyone is limited to the same number of games per day. We’ve often heard from you that in such a system, there’s no motivation to aim for the top if you didn’t start on day one. And everyone loses out because of this.\n\nWe’ve decided to remove the limit on energy recovery for mutagems. From now on, if the price reaches 240 mutagems, it will remain at that level until the end of the day. Yes, starting from the very beginning is still more advantageous, but now everyone has a real chance to compete.\n\n60☢️ → 120☢️ → 240☢️ → 240☢️ → 240☢️…\n\n🔣 **Here’s a reminder of the main ways to earn mutagems:**\n\n__Referrals — 5% of your friends’ earnings go to you.\n\nQuests — provide a fixed number each day and week.\n\nAchievements — a powerful tool in the long run: the longer you play, the more they bring.\n\nBurning unique mutations — the amount depends on the rarity of the card received.\n\nWeekly leaderboard — lets you earn even more mutagems.\n\nMutant Arena — the stronger your fighters, the higher your reward.__\n\nUse these wisely, set your priorities, and remember that we’re still in open beta. Every week we try out new formats, and your feedback helps make the game better.\n\nThank you for being with us. 🫰\nStay tuned for updates.\n\n@mutant_gifts_bot", "date": "2025-09-15T15:10:27+00:00", "chat": "Mutant Gifts Community"}
