You can check the list of winners in the weekly leaderboard tab of @mutant_gifts_bot.\n\nWe noticed that reaching the top 20% was a bit too easy, so we decided to adjust the conditions. Starting today, the weekly raffle will be held among the top 100 players. These conditions may be updated again in the future.\n\nIn addition, we found and fixed several bugs that caused crashes and other issues. The game is now running even more smoothly.\n\nThank you to everyone who helps us grow the project and actively participates in the beta test! 🫰\n\n@mutant_gifts_bot", "date": "2025-09-06T18:20:22+00:00", "chat": "Mutant Gifts Community"}

The more tickets you have, the higher your chance to win. Plus, 20% of all in-game donations still go to the seasonal prize pool, while another portion is allocated to weekly and daily raffles.\n\nStart mutating right now and join the very first daily NFT gift raffle!\n\n@mutant_gifts_bot", "date": "2025-09-06T16:19:44+00:00", "chat": "Mutant Gifts Community"}
