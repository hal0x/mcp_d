{"id": 38, "text": "❓ **Mutant Gifts FAQ**\n\nOur goal is to give Telegram gifts a new layer of utility through gamification. We’re the first in Telegram to combine AI and NFTs in one app. We want to create a unique and fun product that engages players with exciting gameplay, offers chances to win rewards, and makes owning an NFT gift feel more vibrant and entertaining.\n\nLet’s go through some of the most common questions and take a closer look at the key mechanics.\n\n🔣 **What is Mutant Gifts?**\n\nIt’s a competitive, collectible card game. Using built-in AI, every user can create a unique card that incorporates visual elements of their gift. The rarer your NFT collection, the higher your chances of getting a powerful card. You can upgrade it and send it into battle—or burn it for resources.\n\n🔣 **Can I play Mutant Gifts without owning a gift?**\n\nYes, absolutely. Creating a mutant with a gift is a paid feature and just one of the mechanics—it’s not required to play. You can enjoy the game completely free without NFTs. However, using a gift increases your chances of generating a rarer card, gives you a unique fighter for your collection, and rewards you with in-game resources when you burn generated cards.\n\n🔣** Do I need to transfer my gift to create a mutant?**\n\nNo. Your gift stays with you—we only pull information from your Telegram profile showcase.\nImportant: our team will never ask you to transfer your gift!\n\n🔣 **Are there rewards in the game?**\n\nYes. Each season has a seasonal leaderboard with a dynamic prize pool—20% of all player payments go into it. At the end of the season, these funds are used to buy Telegram gifts, which are distributed among the top players. On top of that, there’s a weekly leaderboard. The most active players automatically enter weekly NFT gift raffles and also receive in-game resources. Activity is mainly measured by the number of matches played (with a small factor for results). There are also seasonal events and developer-hosted contests.\n\n🔣 **Why does 20% of donations go to the prize pool?**\n\nThis number wasn’t chosen randomly. We allocate 20% to the prize pool and another 30% (which may change) to Telegram’s referral program. These two alone already account for 50% of our revenue. On top of that, we still have to cover development, marketing, raffles, commissions, and other costs. That’s why 20% is the most sustainable figure for now. As the project grows, we’ll keep reviewing this and may increase it in the future—but at this stage, it’s set at 20%.\n\n🔣 **What’s next?**\n\nRight now, our main focus is gathering feedback, fixing bugs, and adding new mechanics to make the gameplay more engaging. The launch of Season 2 will mark the end of open beta and introduce a lot of new features. Your mutants will remain with you, and we’re already working on a fair progression balance. In the long run, you can expect new classes and synergies, game modes and events, expanded NFT integration, and much more.\n\nFollow our official channels to be the first to know about updates.\n\n@mutant_gifts_bot", "date": "2025-08-28T18:43:53+00:00", "chat": "Mutant Gifts Community"}
