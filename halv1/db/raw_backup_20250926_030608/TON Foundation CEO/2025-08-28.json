{"id": 32, "text": "The beauty of open standards is that they make competition irrelevant to asset ownership.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you buy stickers on Sticker Store, FUSE, or any store launching tomorrow. As long as those stickers are built on the NFT 2.0 standard, they're tradable everywhere that supports the protocol.\n\nThink OpenSea versus Blur. Same NFTs, different venues, same underlying value. You can buy on OpenSea and sell on Blur because both recognize the same Ethereum standards.\n\nThat's exactly what NFT 2.0 does on TON. Every platform implementing this standard can display, trade, and interact with stickers from any other platform.\n\nCreators win regardless of where they mint. Their stickers aren't locked into specific platforms. The culture, community, and value all live on-chain, accessible to any interface that supports the standard.\n\nSome people think different platforms mean different types of stickers or fragmented value. That misses the entire point of decentralized infrastructure.\n\nThis is why the TON Foundation focuses on creating robust, open standards because they enable unlimited innovation on top.\n\nYour digital assets exist independently of any single platform. Competition between platforms becomes about user experience and creator support, not platform lock-in.\n\nCulture and value stay on-chain while interfaces compete to serve users better.\n\nThat's the power of open standards.", "date": "2025-08-28T15:15:03+00:00", "chat": "TON Foundation CEO"}
{"id": 31, "text": "The launch of FUSE yesterday represents something bigger than just another marketplace. It's a practical demonstration of how open standards can create sustainable value for creators, communities, and the ecosystem itself.\n\n**The NFT 2.0 standard on TON is fully open. Any marketplace can integrate and build on it.**\n\nWhen we launched NFT 2.0, the goal was to solve the fundamental problems that plagued NFT ecosystems: unpaid royalties, creator exploitation, and unsustainable economics that prioritized speculation over utility.\n\nFUSE is one example of this vision in action, designed to put value back into creators, Telegram, and the broader TON community. But it is not the only marketplace, nor should it be. **The beauty of open standards is that they enable competition, innovation, and choice.\n**\nThe first sticker stores on TON helped spark this entire narrative, showing what becomes possible when culture meets collectibles in a native blockchain environment. That pioneering work deserves recognition for proving the concept. **Special thanks to ****@takoy_sasha**** for leading that charge and showing what was possible.\n**\n🔥 TON Foundation supports FUSE because it follows a model that prioritizes creators, IP holders, and long-term community sustainability. \n\n**🚨 FUSE operates as a not-for-profit initiative, ensuring maximum value flows back to creators and the community. **\n\n✅ Royalties stay within the ecosystem, sustaining Telegram's infrastructure while fueling a growing community fund.\n\n**This isn't about picking winners. It's about setting standards that ensure creators get paid, communities benefit from growth, and the ecosystem remains open for anyone to build upon.**\n\nBy turning culture into ownership, TON empowers everyone to participate - and its professionalism makes the ecosystem a trusted destination for new brands and communities.", "date": "2025-08-28T10:09:43+00:00", "chat": "TON Foundation CEO"}
