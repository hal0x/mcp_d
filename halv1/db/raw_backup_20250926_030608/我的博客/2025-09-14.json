{"id": 272, "text": "Gift Strategy — Inspired by TON’s Vision\nWe position ourselves as the Gift Strategy in the same way that TON has defined a broader strategic vision.\nOur mission is simple yet powerful:\nto lock the maximum number of gifts for a set period of time, creating scarcity, intrigue, and long-term value.\n\nCore Mechanic\nWe introduce two models of how gifts can be “locked”:\n 1. Price Milestone Unlock — the gift becomes available only once its value reaches 10x the current price.\n 2. Time-Lock Unlock — the gift remains frozen on the account for one year.\nOnce a gift is locked, it cannot be reclaimed earlier — neither by request, nor by any workaround. Only reaching the milestone (price or time) makes it accessible again.\n\nThis creates both collectible scarcity and a sense of long-term commitment — turning gifts into real assets of value.\n\nInvestment Layer\nBeyond individual users, we are opening the door to external investors who want to participate in this new form of digital gifting.\nThey can invest directly into gifts as an asset class, knowing they are locked and protected by our rules of scarcity and time.\nThis bridges the gap between emotional gifting and serious investment mechanics.\n\nFor those who want to participate in this vision, join us now — we are building the future of digital gifting on TON. You can participate in this strategy by sending gift.\n👉@giftsstrategy_relayer\n\nIn essence, this is not just about sending gifts — a new cultural and financial layer in the TON ecosystem.\n\nWitg love, \nLucha", "date": "2025-09-14T15:31:17+00:00", "chat": "我的博客"}
