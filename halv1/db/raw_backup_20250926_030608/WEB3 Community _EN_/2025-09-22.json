In our private chat, we share stories that clearly show that WEB3 is not just about tokens and domains, but about people and their journeys. Today, we are sharing one of them.\n\n🔣 Four years ago, I realized that crypto is the real Wild West. Risks, adventures, untrodden paths. Only instead of dust and revolvers, there is blockchain and the chance to open doors that simply do not exist in employment. **I started from scratch: without investments, through faucets, chats, and my first NFTs.** I ended up in TON by accident — through quests and ciphers, which were generously paid for at the time.\n\n💎 With the first quest from the Domainer, I ended up in a private chat. The subscription paid for itself in a couple of days, and the project's approach turned out to be completely different from most TON initiatives. I stayed, started collecting domains, ecosystem assets, and sharing ideas.\n\n**Domeiner kept his word. He invested like a real business, not «playing at a startup».This is rare for TON. And most importantly, he really believed in the idea and inspired others with it.**\n\nI realized that everything always starts with fifty crazy geeks and ends with generations for whom «Web 3.0» will sound as familiar as «the internet».Today's domainers are the cowboys of the new digital frontier, the first to explore these lands.\n\n👁 For me, domaining in Web 3.0 is not just TON DNS. It's a new revolution that happens once in a hundred years: finance, the internet, IT. My bet is on life.\n\n[**__WEB3 Private__**](https://t.me/web3ton/279)__ is not about words, but about actions. Here, people turn risk into opportunity and ideas into reality.__\n\n\n#MIND 　**🥳** [Mini App](https://t.me/tondnsclub/app) | [Ecosystem news](https://t.me/web3ton) | [X](https://x.com/web3tondns)", "date": "2025-09-22T12:33:04+00:00", "chat": "WEB3 Community [EN]"}
