{"id": 9328, "text": "**«As you name the ship, so shall it sail»: the founder of WEB3 speaks out**\n\nNext comes the first-person story from the one without whom there would be neither this channel nor the entire ecosystem: Domainer.\n\n👋 I didn’t catch the golden era of Web 2.0, when domainers were making fortunes selling names. But as I studied the market, I realized one thing: __the key is to see opportunities and not be afraid to jump in when the window opens.__ For me, that window was TON DNS. When I first discovered .ton domains, I saw the same unique chances I had once missed in Web 2.0. It became clear: the next big market would be domaining in Web 3.0.\n\n👁 Immersing myself in TON DNS, I began acquiring .ton domains en masse. Later I realized: **there were many enthusiasts like me, and we needed to unite. **That’s how TON DNS Club was born — first as an author’s channel and a chat, and later as the first meeting point for domainers in TON. It was then that I took the pseudonym Domainer, securing the matching domain and username.\n\n🪙 **Over the years of promoting projects I learned for sure:** a name isn’t a detail, it’s a foundation. It can open doors or close them. That’s why, for our utility token, I chose a strong and symbolic name — WEB3. Thanks to our rapid rise and results in the Open League, people started talking about us, and the name became tied to our entire ecosystem. That’s how we evolved from TON DNS Club to WEB3.\n\n🥇 __Today, with Web 3.0 and blockchain set to dominate the narrative for years ahead, we have a powerful name, strong recognition, and native promotion. But most importantly — we’re building a market that will become the foundation of the new internet.\n\n\n__#MIND　**🥳** [Mini App](https://t.me/tondnsclub/app) | [Ecosystem news](https://t.me/web3ton) | [X](https://x.com/web3tontoken)", "date": "2025-09-15T13:33:09+00:00", "chat": "WEB3 Community [EN]"}
