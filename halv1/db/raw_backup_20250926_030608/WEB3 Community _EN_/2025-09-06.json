You are part of WEB3 ❤️\n\n🏁 [**Two Years Online**](https://t.me/web3tondns/803)\n🔣 It’s been 2 years since the very first WEB3 post!\n🔣 From an idea and a single post to a whole ecosystem with domains, NFTs, and a marketplace.\n\n🏁 [**Scripts in the .ton Market**](https://t.me/web3ton/281)\n🔣 The auction for `society.ton `lasted over 13 hours and for the first time showed bots/scripts taking part.\n🔣 Entering the market is no longer so simple: you now compete not only with people but with automated systems.\n\n🏁 [**Domainer’s Horoscope**](https://t.me/web3tondns/804)\n🔣 Instead of heavy updates, we made some «light content» to help ease into the first week of autumn.\n🔣 A bit of irony, a few predictions, and a pinch of charlatanism — WEB3’s horoscope.\n\n🏁 [**webdom Audit**](https://t.me/web3ton/282)\n🔣 The marketplace is undergoing its final smart contract audit.\n🔣 After 2 weeks of testing, not a single error was found — transactions are stable and secure.\n\n🥳 __Autumn is here, but we’re not slowing down. Stay tuned for updates!\n__\n\n#RECAP 　**🥳** [Mini App](https://t.me/tondnsclub/app) | [Ecosystem news](https://t.me/web3ton) | [X](https://x.com/web3tondns)", "date": "2025-09-06T14:33:09+00:00", "chat": "WEB3 Community [EN]"}
