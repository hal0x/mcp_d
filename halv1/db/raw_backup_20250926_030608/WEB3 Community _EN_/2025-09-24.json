But the downside: RU & EN are mixed together, and topics have no structure.\n\n2️⃣ [**The second one**](https://t.me/web3jetton) — a leftover from earlier days, quiet for now, but with threads and a neat split by languages and topics.\n\n**❓**** Question to you: do we move the action to the second chat or keep hanging out where we are?\n\n\n**#FLOCK 　**🥳** [Mini App](https://t.me/tondnsclub/app) | [Ecosystem news](https://t.me/web3ton) | [X](https://x.com/web3tondns)", "date": "2025-09-24T10:33:10+00:00", "chat": "WEB3 Community [EN]"}
